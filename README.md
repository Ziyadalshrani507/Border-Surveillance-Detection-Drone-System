# 🛡️ Border Surveillance Detection Drone System

An autonomous **border surveillance drone simulation** built using **PX4**, **Gazebo**, **ROS 2**, and **thermal imaging**.  
The system simulates a UAV capable of detecting and inspecting heat-emitting targets such as humans and rockets using a thermal camera.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Border Surveillance Detection Drone System** is a fully simulated autonomous UAV platform designed for border monitoring scenarios.  
It integrates flight control, perception, and mission logic to demonstrate how a surveillance drone can patrol, detect thermal targets, and react autonomously.

This project is intended for **research, education, and prototyping** and can be extended toward real-world deployment.
