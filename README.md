#  Border Surveillance Detection Drone System

This project simulates a border surveillance and detection drone system aimed at improving security and situational awareness in restricted border areas. Autonomous drones patrol predefined zones, detect suspicious activities, and provide real-time alerts to operators through a monitoring system.

---

##  Project Overview

The **Border Surveillance Detection Drone System** is a fully simulated autonomous UAV platform designed for border monitoring scenarios.  
It integrates flight control, perception, and mission logic to demonstrate how a surveillance drone can patrol, detect thermal targets, and react autonomously.

This project is intended for **research, education, and prototyping** and can be extended toward real-world deployment.

---

##  Objectives

- Detect and monitor **smuggling attempts** by individuals, vehicles, or any object that emits heat using thermal imaging  
- Perform **autonomous drone patrols** along predefined GPS-based border routes  
- Conduct **inspection and investigation maneuvers** (hovering, orbiting, close-range observation) before border guard or human intervention  
- Integrate **PX4 flight control** with **ROS 2–based perception and sensor processing pipelines**  
- Simulate **realistic border surveillance scenarios**, including night operations and low-visibility conditions  
- Enable **early threat detection and situational awareness** to reduce human risk and response time

## Mission Logic

The drone mission follows these steps:

  1-Arm and take off to a predefined altitude

  2-Navigate to mission waypoints

  3-Descend for close inspection when reaching a target

  4-Orbit the target for surveillance

  5-Continue to the next target

  6-Return to launch automatically

  7-Mission logic is implemented using Python with MAVSDK.

## Mission Logic

The autonomous mission follows a *patrol → detect → investigate → report* loop:

1. **Define Patrol Block (Area Assignment)**
   - The drone is deployed with a specific border segment / block to cover (geofence-style area).
   - Patrol coverage is planned as a sweep pattern (e.g., lawnmower/grid) to ensure full visibility.

2. **Arm & Takeoff**
   - Drone arms and climbs to a safe patrol altitude.

3. **Camera Initialization & Adjustment**
   - The gimbal/thermal camera is set to a surveillance angle (typically downward pitch).
   - Camera settings can be adjusted dynamically during flight depending on altitude and target distance.

4. **Autonomous Border Survey (Patrol Mode)**
   - Drone flies the patrol route across the assigned block.
   - Thermal + visual streams are continuously monitored in ROS 2 perception pipelines.

5. **Suspicious Activity Detection**
   - If suspicious heat signatures or movement are detected (individuals, vehicles, or hot objects),
     the drone marks the location and triggers an alert event.

6. **Investigation / Inspection Mode**
   - Drone transitions from patrol to investigation behavior:
     - slows down and stabilizes position,
     - descends to an inspection altitude (optional),
     - performs an orbit (or loiter) around the detected target to collect evidence.
   - Captures thermal imagery + optional RGB snapshots/video and timestamps.

7. **Report & Handover**
   - Detection metadata is published to ROS 2 (target type, confidence, GPS location).
   - Evidence is logged for operators/border guards to verify before ground interaction.

8. **Resume Patrol or Return-To-Launch (RTL)**
   - If targets remain: mission returns to patrol and continues coverage.
   - If mission time/battery limits reached: drone performs RTL automatically.

Mission logic is implemented using **Python + MAVSDK** for flight control,
while **ROS 2** handles perception, target classification, and event reporting.
